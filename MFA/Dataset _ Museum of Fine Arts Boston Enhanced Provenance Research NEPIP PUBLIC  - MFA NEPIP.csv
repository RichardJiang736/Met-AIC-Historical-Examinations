Coolidge,Europe,Paintings,"Andrea del Sarto’s serene paintings often combine crisp draperies with blurred contours of facial features, limbs, and hands. Sarto—so named for his father’s profession as a sarto, or tailor—taught many of the brightest talents in Florence, including Rosso Fiorentino. But he also absorbed contemporary influences. This early work seems to be based on a specific Virgin and Child painting, now lost, by the slightly older Raphael.","By 1827, possibly Joseph Strutt (b. 1765 - d. 1844), Derby, England [see note 1], by 1878, Edward Strutt, 1st Baron Belper (b. 1801 - d. 1880), Kingston Hall, Nottinghamshire [see note 2], by descent within the Strutt family, probably to Alexander Ronald Strutt (b. 1912 - d. 1999), 4th Baron Belper [see note 3], 1960, sold from the Lord Belper collection to Agnew's, London (stock no. 32592), July 19, 1971, sold by Agnew's to William A.

There was an auction of paintings from his collection in 1889, but nothing by Andrea del Sarto was included.;[2] In 1878, Lord Belper lent a painting of the Virgin and Child by Andrea del Sarto to the Nottingham Castle Museum, where it was cat. no. 49 (the number ""48"" is inscribed, perhaps mistakenly, on the verso of the MFA painting). In 1881, a Virgin and Child was likewise recorded in the collection of Lord Belper at Kingston Hall, see Leonard Jacks, The Great Houses of Nottinghamshire (1881), pp. 67-68, who suggested that it was among the pictures purchased by Edward Strutt (nephew of Joseph Strutt) from the Duke d'Alberg. Edward Strutt did acquire paintings that can be identified in the Duke d'Alberg collection sale of 1817, the only Andrea del Sarto painting of the Virgin and Child auctioned at that time, however, also included St. John and three angels.;[3] According to information provided by Agnew's, London, this painting was acquired from Lord Belper. At the time it was sold to William Coolidge, it was said to come from an English private collection formed in the mid-nineteenth century."

Here, Christ blesses the recumbent Virgin while holding her diminutive soul. The three figures along the bottom edge probably represent the patrons who commissioned the painting.","By 1420, possibly the nobles of Weitmuehl, Kosátsky Castle, near Jungbunzlau (now Mladá Boleslav, Czech Republic) [see note 1], by the late 15th century, the counts of Kolowrat, Kosátsky Castle [see note 2], until 1950, by descent within the family to Henry Kolowrat, New York, 1950, sold by Henry Kolowrat to Henry Pearlman (b. 1895 - d. 1974), New York [see note 3], 1950, probably sold by Mr. Pearlman to E. and A.

In a letter from Henry Kolowrat to Henry Pearlman (January 6, 1950), the painting is said to have been in the possession of his family for about 500 years, though he does not specify how it was acquired. From 1934 to 1939, it was on loan from Kolowrat to the National Museum, Prague (inv. no. OP2110).;[3] In the letter from Kolowrat to Pearlman (see above, n. 2) the author writes ""I am glad to have sold you the Bohemian panel painting, 'Death of the Virgin.;[4] According to correspondence in the MFA curatorial file, the painting was with Silberman by early May, 1950.

Only one still life is now convincingly attributed to Caravaggio, but his influence can be seen in many Italian examples.","17th century, said to have been acquired in Italy by the Earls of Leicester, Penshurst Place, Kent, England and passed by descent within the Sidney family to William Philip Sidney (b. 1909 - d. 1991), 6th Baron De L'Isle and Dudley, Penshurst Place [see note 1], by about 1949, sold by the Baron de L'Isle and Dudley, possibly to or through Hans Gronau (b. 1904 - d. 1951), London [see note 2].

(Accession Date: September 21, 1960);NOTES;[1] Sold with a companion panel, as by H[endrick] van Avercamp, whose monogram the painting falsely bears. The two panels are documented together, as pendants, through the 1956 auction.;[2] This provenance (A. S. Van den Bergh and E. Marx collections) is given for the companion panel in Clara J. Welcker, Hendrick Avercamp 1585 - 1634 Beijgenaamd 'De Stomme van Campen' en Barent Avercamp 1612 - 1679, 'Schilders tot Campen', revised ed. with catalogue raisonné by D. J. Hensbroek-van der Poel (Davaco, 1979), p. 330, cat. no. B.A. S 5.6, and is taken from documentation on file at the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie, The Hague. The provenance of the MFA painting has been confirmed by the familial descendants of Arnold Simon van den Bergh, in whose home it was photographed in the 1930s.;[3] Eugen Marx, the son-in-law of Arnold Simon van den Bergh, was a prominent Jewish ophthalmologist in Rotterdam. With the German invasion of the Netherlands, he and his wife committed suicide on May 14, 1940. At that time, this painting and its companion were taken by Hendrika Christina Floberg, an assistant to Dr. Marx in his ophthalmological practice. She attested in the 1950s that Dr. Marx had left a note giving her the ""winter landscapes"". Eugen and Berta Marx's heirs sought to reclaim the two Avercamp paintings in the 1950s, challenging Miss Floberg's right to take them in 1940. In 1956, it was ruled that the Marx heirs could not demonstrate that Miss Floberg had appropriated the paintings illegally, and as a result their claim was denied (also see below, note 4). Information on the painting's provenance between 1940 and 1949 was provided by the Dutch Restitutions Committee.;[4] Dr. Van Hengel lent the painting to the exhibition “Avercamp: Tentoonstelling te Kampen,” Oude Raadhuis, Kampen, July 9 - August 13, 1949. By 1952, the heirs of Eugen and Berta Marx sought unsuccessfully to re-acquire the painting and its companion from Van Hengel. In 1953, after his death, the paintings were publicly consigned for sale against the wishes of the Marx family, and were bought back by Van Hengel's heirs. Between 1954 and 1956, the Marx family pursued legal measures to recover the two paintings. In a judgment of June 15, 1956, the Restoration of Rights Court in the Hague denied the application made by the Marx family, stating that there was no proof of unlawful appropriation by Miss Floberg in 1940. The paintings remained with the Van Hengel heirs, and were auctioned again at the end of that year.;[5] According to Duits Records, Index Cards (Getty Research Institute, No. 860290, Box 37). Correspondence from Charles Duits to Angelica Rudenstine of the MFA (February 4, 1963), states that it came from the ""collection Doodenhever [sic] in Holland who exhibited it at a small gallery under the name of Barent Avercamp, where we discovered it."" Although the painting was consigned anonymously to the 1959 Sotheby's sale, where Duits acquired it, Doodeheefver is known to have consigned other works of art anonymously to the same auction.;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION;After Eugen and Berta Marx took their own lives, the contents of their household were auctioned by Otto van Leersum of Amsterdam in 1941. However, by this time, the two paintings by Avercamp were already in the possession of Hendrika Christina Floberg. She had served for about eleven years as Dr. Marx's ophthalmological assistant. Information provided by the Dutch Restitutions Committee has shown that by the 1950s, Eugen and Berta Marx's heirs sought to challenge Miss Floberg's taking of the paintings in 1940, and to recover the paintings in question. They pursued their claim with the Restoration of Rights Court in the Hague. The court called on the Marx heirs to prove by witness statements that Miss Floberg had illegally appropriated the panels. Miss Floberg attested that after the death of Dr. and Mrs. Marx, she had uncovered a note giving her ""the paintings, winter landscapes, and some books."" Another witness, the Marxes' domestic servant, Leentje van der Steen-Groen, attested that the note ""said nothing about paintings being left to Miss Floberg."" The note was subsequently torn up. The court ruled on June 15, 1956, that ""it has by no means gained the conviction that the paintings in question were not given to Miss Floberg as a keepsake from Dr. Marx.;This information is taken from the Dutch Restitutions Committee, Research Report, RC, MFA-1, January 23, 2015."

The lute, for example, was the instrument of love, and many amorous songs were composed for it.

When he asks the lame man why he does not heal himself, the man replies that whenever he approaches the water, someone faster crowds him aside. Jesus then tells the man to stand up and walk, and he is healed. Bassano chooses the moment of verbal interchange, making the story clear through a complex network of glances and gestures.

(Accession Date: November 14, 1946);NOTES;[1] Koenigs was a Protestant German businessman living in the Netherlands. Along with other drawings and paintings from his art collection, this landscape was on loan to the Museum Boymans, Rotterdam, from 1935 to 1940. It was included in the exhibition catalogues ""Ausstellung alter Malerei aus Privatbesitz"" (Kunstverein, Düsseldorf, June 1 - July 15, 1929), cat. no. 5 and ""Verzameling Koenigs Schilderijen"" (Museum Boymans, Rotterdam, 1935), cat. no. 12.;[2] In 1931, Koenigs took out a loan from Lisser and Rosenkranz bank, using his art collection as collateral. In 1935 the terms of this loan were formalized: Koenigs gave the bank the right to sell the collection, if necessary, when the loan became due in June 1940, or if the bank was liquidated before this five-year term was up. On April 2, 1940, Lisser and Rosenkranz did go into liquidation and Koenig's debt became due. On this date the bank declared itself the sole owner of the art collection.;[3] By the end of 1939 it had already become clear that Koenigs would not be able to pay off his loan to Lisser and Rosenkranz before the due date of June, 1940, without selling his art collection. Jacques Goudstikker gallery had been employed on behalf of Koenigs and Lisser and Rosenkranz to help sell the collection. On April 19, Goudstikker collected thirty-five paintings from the Koenigs collection on behalf of Lisser and Rosenkranz, in order to sell them.;[4] On May 15, 1940, Hitler's second-in command, Hermann Goering, visited Goudstikker accompanied by his chief purchasing agent, Andreas Hofer, and his friend Alois Miedl. In June, Miedl purchased thirty-one paintings from the Koenigs collection from Goudstikker. Evidence suggests that Franz Koenigs himself was active in the sale of these paintings and understood the conditions of the sale. According to interviews with Jacques Goudstikker's widow and Miedl, Koenigs approved of Miedl's intention to offer one of the paintings as a gift to Goering and may have offered his assistance with this.;[5] Miedl sold nineteen paintings, including the Landscape with Burning City, to Hermann Goering. They were delivered to his residence at Carinhall, Germany, on June 10, 1940. In early 1945, Goering attempted to safeguard his collection by shipping the objects from Carinhall to Berchtesgaden in Bavaria. The train was intercepted by the Allies. Much of the collection was recovered, but numerous articles were also looted, possibly by Allied troops and by the local population. Some objects were found in private homes and on the black market. They were returned to the Netherlands and became the property of the Dutch government. This painting, however, was not recovered. For further on the shipments from Carinhall, see Nancy H. Yeide, Beyond the Dreams of Avarice: The Hermann Goering Collection (Dallas: Laurel Publishing, 2009), p. 16, and for information on the MFA painting, p. 292, cat. no. A452.;[6] In 1946 the MFA purchased the painting from Aram Gallery, in New York. Siegfried F. Aram (letter to the MFA, September 20, 1948) attested that he had purchased it from Julian Acampora, a New York restorer, and that it had come from the collection of the Count d'Urbania. After inquiring further about its history, Aram was told that it been with Devany's auction galleries, New York, and that it had come from a collection in Chicago. This account is inconsistent and was almost certainly fabricated.;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION;By 1948 the MFA was aware that the painting had come from Carinhall and was being sought by the Dutch government. The museum entered discussions with the authorities in the Netherlands at this time. In a letter from A. P. A Vorenkamp, Director of Boymans Museum, to George Edgell, Director of the MFA (November 25, 1948), he confirmed that he had ""turned the 'Herri met de Bles affair' over"" to the General Commission of Recuperation, Amsterdam. However, the MFA was not contacted by the Commission. In 1998, the MFA again contacted the Netherlands, corresponding with the Inspectorate of Cultural Heritage. It was confirmed that the painting was missing from the Netherlands and it could not be determined why it had not been returned.;An heir of Franz Koenigs has also claimed to have legal title to the objects sold through Goudstikker, on the grounds that Koenigs was forced to sell his possessions at a cost below fair market value. On November 3, 2003, the Dutch Advisory Committee on the Assessment of Restitution Applications rejected these claims. The resolution, ""Advice concerning the application for restitution of the Koenigs collection,"" is accessible online at: https://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/en/summary_rc_16.html;The MFA awaits communication from the interested parties regarding their attempts to reach a neutral resolution of the ownership of the painting."

Sweetser Fund, and Charles Edward French Fund",Europe,Paintings,"In the 18th century, a foreign visitor to Venice would have been astounded by the sprawling view Canaletto captures here. The urban center was arguably the bacino, the city’s bay and main harbor, water and boats were central to Venetian life and commerce. Here, Dutch and English flags fly on ships in the mid-ground, underscoring the city’s cosmopolitan nature. Although Canaletto painted his cityscapes with great precision, he also allowed himself to take liberties with the details of a scene and combined several viewpoints in order to produce a more “picturesque” composition.","About 1738/1739, possibly Henry Howard (b. 1694 - d. 1758), 4th Earl of Carlisle, Castle Howard, North Yorkshire, England (original commission), or in 1768, acquired in Italy by Frederick Howard (b. 1748 - d. 1825), 5th Earl of Carlisle [see note 1], by descent within the family to the Hon. Geoffrey William Algernon Howard (b. 1877 - d. 1935), Castle Howard [see note 2], 1939, sold by the Trustees of the late Hon. Geoffrey Howard through Spink and Son, Ltd., London, to the MFA for $11,731.25. (Accession Date: September 8, 1939);NOTES;[1] Exactly when and how the painting entered the Carlisle collection is unclear. The bulk of the art collection at Castle Howard was acquired by Frederick, 5th Earl of Carlisle, who traveled to Italy in 1768. However, at least some of the paintings by Canaletto may have been acquired by his father, as several unspecified views of Venice by the artist were recorded at the Castle in 1745. The 4th Earl of Carlisle arrived in Venice on his Grand Tour in November, 1738, and he may have commissioned the paintings at that time. This hypothesis is supported by details of the painting's topography, which suggest that it was executed about 1738/1739, that is, when the cupola of the church of S. Antonin was in its final phase of construction. To the right of San Zaccaria one can see the church with scaffolding still on the steeple, and the cupola near completion. On Canaletto paintings in the Howard collection, see W. G. Constable, ""Canaletto"", 2d ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989), vol. 2, pp. 203 and 250, cat. no. 131. On the representation of S. Antonin and the dating of the painting to the late 1730s, see Alessandro Bettagno, ""In margine a una mostra,"" Notizie da Palazzo Albani XII, nos. 1-2 (1983), pp. 227-228, supported by Katharine Baetjer and J. G. Links, ""Canaletto"" (New York, 1989), pp. 192-196, cat. no. 51. The suggestion that the 4th Earl of Carlisle commissioned the views of Venice from Canaletto in 1738/1739 was made by Charles Beddington (correspondence to the MFA, February 23, 2005).;[2] There may have been as many as sixteen paintings by Canaletto in the Castle Howard collection by the early twentieth century. This painting has been identified by Constable (as above, n. 1) as the composition singled out from the collection in 1854 by G. F. Waagen: ""Large View of Venice. In every respect one of the best works of this master."" See Waagen, Treasures of Art in Great Britain, vol. 3 (London, 1854), p. 323, no. 64. It may also be the ""General View of the Harbour in Venice.

The Bankhaus Aufhäuser was Aryanized in 1938, and Siegfried Aufhäuser emigrated through England to the United States. Parke-Bernet galleries held a number of sales of objects from his collection in the 1940s."

Theresa B. Hopkins Fund,Europe,Paintings,"The liberally applied white highlights and twisting forms of the leaves are signature elements of the still lifes produced by Giovanni Paolo Spadino in Rome during the 1690s. Unlike the meticulous, studied method of depicting fruit and vegetation that was popular in Rome at the beginning of the seventeenth century, the looser brushwork used to paint Peaches and Pears in a Glass Bowl reflects a more relaxed approach to the genre at the century’s end. Spadino borrows the motif of the glass bowl piled high with ripe fruit from Rome’s most prominent still-life painter at the time, the Flemish expatriate Abraham Brueghel, who was Spadino’s neighbor from 1671 until 1674. Although foreign-born artists, like Brueghel, set the trends in still-life painting at the time, Spadino was able to find a market for his work. His paintings are found in inventories of aristocratic collections in both Rome and Naples.","About 1911, Anna Barberini Colonna (b. 1840 - d. 1911), Tagliacozzo, Abruzzo, Italy [see note 1], by descent within the family and, about 1958, sold by the Corsini family to Luigi Albrighi, Florence [see note 2], 1959, sold by Albrighi to the MFA for $6000.

In this picture, made near the end of his life, the artist painted himself with a detachment that bordered on abstraction in the clean, geometric volumes of the hat, the barely indicated chair, the stark planes of cheekbone and forehead.

Gould lent the painting to the Saint Louis Exposition, 1904, cat. no. 90.;[4] According to John Mitchell, in a letter to W.G. Constable of the MFA (February 17, 1948), James McClean purchased the painting ""fifty to sixty-five years ago"" in England. However, George Jay Gould still owned it in 1904, so it must have been acquired at a later date than the dealer claimed."

Spaulding,Europe,Paintings,"Gustave Courbet returned to still-life painting in 1871 while serving a six-month prison sentence for aiding in the destruction of the Vendôme Column during the Paris Commune. After his requests for live models and access to the prison roof for landscape views were denied, he had his sister bring fruit and flowers to his cell. Hollyhocks in a Copper Bowl was likely painted after the artist had been transferred from the prison to a sanatorium because of his failing health. Such late still lifes are humbler than his earlier work in the genre. Placed against a dark background, the floral arrangement in Hollyhocks in a Copper Bowl exists almost entirely in shadow. The ethereal appearance of the white hollyhocks, painted quickly in short, broad brushstrokes gives the still life a melancholic tone. Courbet’s late still lifes arguably record his internal struggle to center himself in his art after great disappointment and public disgrace. The more somber tone of his works after his imprisonment may also reflect his savvy awareness of how his personal scandal could be used to sell paintings.","1872, probably M.

While this does match the description of the MFA work, Oretti also referred to the subject as the ""famous singer"" Vittoria Tesi (b. 1700)--who could not plausibly be the woman in the MFA painting, given its date of around 1700-05. However, if Oretti's identification of the subject was incorrect, this may well be one of the paintings that the Marchesini family had inherited from Giovanni Ricci, a Bolognese merchant and patron of Crespi."

In the Ecologues of the ancient Roman poet Virgil, this seer famously prophesized the birth of a savior. Christians subsequently interpreted Virgil’s text in reference to the birth of Jesus, to which Creti alludes in the Latin inscription on the paper at upper left. The comparatively small scale of this image lends itself well to Creti’s meticulous manner of painting. Particularly noteworthy is the still life of pink roses and marsh marigolds at lower right, flowers that traditionally bore strong associations with the Virgin.","November 23-25, 1983, anonymous (German private collector) sale, Lempertz, Cologne, lot 1482. 1984, sold by Piero Corsini, New York and London, to the MFA.

Their father, a Frenchman who fled to Naples during the French Revolution, eventually established a banking house there. This is the last of Degas's great family portraits. It is also among the most surprising. The portrayal of the artist's Aunt Fanny is without flattery, delicately balanced between austerity and empathy. Her frontal, static, focused image is contrasted with the lively bearing of her daughters, whose sense of movement is increased by the offhand way in which the artist painted, then wiped away, their portraits.","Probably given by the artist to his aunt, Stéphanie De Gas Primicile-Carafa, Marquesa di Cicerale and Duchessa di Montejasi (b. 1819 - d. 1901), Naples [see note 1]. 1923, sold by Vincent Imberti (dealer), Bordeaux, France to David David-Weill (b. 1871 - d. 1952), Paris and Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, by descent to his grandchildren, Paris, 2003, sold by the descendants of David David-Weill to the MFA.

The painting was purchased in Vollard's name, but, according to Durand-Ruel's records, all four parties paid for it (Bernheim-Jeune, Durand-Ruel, and Vollard were experts at the sale). Seligmann acquired full possession of the paintings by 1920, in the prefatory note to the catalogue of his 1921 auction are statements by Durand-Ruel, Vollard, and Bernheim-Jeune attesting to his ownership of seventy-one paintings purchased at the Degas atelier sale.;[2] Henry D. Hughes acquired at least two other Degas paintings at the Seligmann sale of 1921 through New York dealers. It is therefore likely, though it has not been proved, that he acquired this painting through Kraushaar.;[3] Mrs. McAndrew first lent the painting to the MFA in 1964. Her mother was George C. Lee's sister, therefore she was Mrs. Lee's niece by marriage. More information on their relationship is in the MFA curatorial file."

The artist recorded the payment he received on the stretchers of both paintings. He began work on the David in 1670 and received his final payment in 1681.;[2] In the 1870 Demidoff auction catalogue, the pendant to this work (lot 148) is said to have remained with the Rinuccini family until 1853, at which time it came to San Donato, it is implied that the David has an identical history. It is unclear whether the paintings were acquired at the Rinuccini sale of May, 1852, or at that held in Paris in December of that year (""Tableaux des écoles italienne, hollandaise, flamande et française,"" Bonnefons de Lavialle, Paris, December 6-8, 1852).

The painting is recorded in the inventory drawn up at Mannheim in 1730 (no. 132: ""An old woman cutting bread, with a boy holding a candle in his hand"") and is visible in the drawings made of the cabinet walls there in 1731.

The painting is also included in the 1756 ""inventory of the princely art collection at Mannheim"" (Verzeichnis der in den Churfürstlichen Cabinetten zu Mannheim befindlichen Mahlereyen, no. 109: ""An old woman sits at a table, cutting a loaf of bread, in front of the table stands a boy with a light, behind is a smaller boy, who eats something with a spoon""). See ""Geschichte der kurfürstlichen Gemäldegalerie in Mannheim,"" in Mannheimer Geschichtsblätter 27 (1926): 38.;[3] In 1777, Karl Theodor, already Elector of the Palatine, inherited the Electorate of Bavaria and the estates of the House of Wittelsbach. Thereafter, the Mannheim Galerie was legally merged with the Wittelsbach family collections.;[4] With Karl Theodor's death in 1799, the Sulzbach line of succession became extinct. The Electorates of both the Palatine and Bavaria passed to Maximilian Joseph, who, as Duke of Zweibrücken (since 1795) was the most senior prince. He became Maximilian I, King of Bavaria, in 1806, at which point the Mannheim Galerie was transferred to the Wittelsbach estate in Munich.;[5] In 1836 King Ludwig I (r. 1825 - 1848) opened the Pinakothek in Munich to exhibit the royal painting collection. It was renamed the Alte Pinakothek with the opening of the Neue Pinakothek across the street in 1853.;[6] In the 1930s, the director of the Bavarian State Paintings Collection, Ernst Buchner, deaccessioned many paintings at the Alte Pinakothek to trade for German works of art. At least seventy-four Dutch paintings, including the Dou, were deaccessioned at this time. In a letter to Dr. Buchner of February 22, 1937, Eduard Plietzsch confirmed the conditions of the trade: in exchange for three German altarpiece panels, he would receive the Dou and a small landscape by Jan Brueghel the Elder, this is confirmed in the registers of the Alte Pinakothek. According to David Alan Brown and Jane Van Niemen (Raphael and the Beautiful Banker [London and New Haven, 2005], p. 218, n. 17), the official date of the trade was March 3, 1937. While Plietzsch received the painting, by April the dealer Heinz Steinmeyer was offering it for sale. In a letter of April 21, 1937 Steinmeyer attested that the Alte Pinakothek had asked to trade the Dou for a German painting. In order to compensate the seller of the German painting, Steinmeyer needed first to sell the Dou. For further information on the deaccessions, see Jonathan Petropoulos, The Faustian Bargain: The Art World in Nazi Germany (Oxford, 2000), 31-32."

He painted many members of the court, including the mistresses of Louis XV: Madame de Pompadour, Madame Du Barry, and the likely sitter for this portrait, Mademoiselle Haynault. Haynault’s fantastical costume—with its ermine, embroidery, and yards of pearls—reflects a contemporary French vogue for all things Turkish, a phenomenon known as turquerie.","Probably passed by descent from the sitter to the Comte de Tournon, Château de Montmelas, Comte de Chabannes Lapalisse, Château de Montmelas [see note 1].

A photograph that shows the painting hanging in the great lounge of the Château de Montmelas and evidence of the painting's inclusion in an inventory of the Tournon family's collection (kindly provided by Benoît Repellin) confirm this information.;The identity of the subject of this portrait has been debated, as a result of what now seems to have been the persistent confusion of two women, Anne Couffier de Romans and Marguerite-Catherine Hainault, both mistresses of Louis XV in the early 1760s. At the time of its sale to Forsyth Wickes in 1930, it was said to depict Mademoiselle de Romans, probably on the basis of the catalogue for a 1910 exhibition, ""Maîtres du XVIIIe siècle: Cent portraits de femmes des écoles française et anglaise,"" in which another painting of the same sitter was presented as Romans. Previously the MFA identified the sitter in its painting as Romans, relying on biographical information and the physical description of her provided by Giacomo Casanova in his memoirs, see Eric M. Zafran, ""French Paintings in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,"" vol. 1 (Boston, 1998), p. 132, cat. no. 56. Today it seems very likely that the sitter was Mademoiselle Hainault, who would become the marquise de Montmelas, and whose family at the Château de Montmelas inherited the painting."

Today he is celebrated for both his unprecedented delicacy and his vigorous storytelling. Here, below the cross, mourners coalesce in shared grief around the swooning Virgin. On the other side, the violent gesticulations of soldiers and onlookers explode outwards in confusion. The saints on the wings possibly represent the patron saints of the unidentified owner. Given the demand for his work, Duccio took on assistants who were trained in his style. One of them probably executed most of the central panel, basing the composition on prototypes by the master. This compact triptych was easily portable for use in private devotion. Although made of wood, the meticulous construction, gold backgrounds, and profusion of fine detail make this a precious object.

In 1762, philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau published Emile, or On Education, a treatise that included advice on raising morally and physically strong children. Rousseau encouraged mothers to breastfeed their children, promoted outdoor exploration, and supported the practice of good hygiene. Images of these 18th-century maternal and domestic ideals make up a substantial portion of Fragonard’s oeuvre.

There he painted scenes of everyday life invested with symbolic, even religious, significance. Here two Breton peasants sit in the shade. The right-hand figure seems at first to be praying, but in fact she’s eating—holding a piece of fruit, perhaps, in her left hand and a knife in her right. The painting demonstrates a shift in Gauguin’s style away from the brushy, Impressionistic manner of his early career towards the broad, flat expanses of color that characterize his Tahitian pictures.","February 23, 1891, Gauguin sale, Hôtel Drouot, Paris, lot 23 (no. 24 in the procès-verbaux) to Ker-Xavier Roussel, (b. 1867 - d. 1944), Paris, for 280 fr., owned jointly by Roussel, Paul Sérusier, Maurice Denis, Pierre Bonnard, Edouard Vuillard (b. 1868 - d. 1940), Frédéric Henry, and Julien Magnin [see note 1], 1905, acquired fully by Vuillard [see note 2], 1940, by inheritance to Vuillard's nephew (and Roussel's son), Jacques Roussel, Paris, 1954, sold by Jacques Roussel to Georges Maratier for Jean Davray, Paris, 1964, sold by Davray to Alex Maguy, Paris, 1964, sold by Maguy to Harry and Mildred Remis, Boston, 1976, partial gift of Harry and Mildred Remis to the MFA, 2001, remaining interest passed by descent to Robert and Ruth Remis, Boston, 2007, gift of Robert and Ruth Remis to the MFA.

Roussel's brother, a doctor) were also joint owners of this painting (see letter from Juliet Bareau to Barbara Shapiro, March 11, 1985, in MFA curatorial file). [2] In a letter from Daniel Wildenstein to Barbara Shapiro (January 28, 1976, in MFA curatorial file), the family of Vuillard and Roussel are said to have provided the following information: Sérusier, Denis, Bonnard, Vuillard, and Roussel bought this painting jointly in 1891 to help Gauguin, and rotated it among themselves for specified periods of time. This arrangement soon grew impossible and it was Vuillard who finally paid back the other four owners and kept the painting for himself. When he died, his nephew and Roussel's son, Jacques Roussel, inherited it. This is supplemented by information provided in the correspondence of Frédéric Henry (see above, n. 1) that Julien Magnin was in possession of the painting at the time of his death in October 1905, at which time the remaining joint owners drew lots to establish sole ownership. Presumably Vuillard acquired it in this way."

In Tahiti, he created paintings that express a highly personal mythology. He considered this work—created in 1897, at a time of great personal crisis—to be his masterpiece and the summation of his ideas. Gauguin's letters suggest that the fresco-like painting should be read from right to left, beginning with the sleeping infant.

With the fall of France to Hitler in June of that year, his family fled the country. German law forbade the return of those who had left occupied territory, so his family was unable to assert its claim to the works of art. A surrogate administrator was appointed to manage the family's affairs and the art collection was auctioned in Paris in 1941. While the estate received the revenue from the sale, the family lost its ownership of the paintings.;In 1997, Mr. Gentili di Giuseppe's heirs brought legal action against the Musée du Louvre and the State of France to have the April 1941 sale declared null and void. On June 2, 1999, the Court of Appeals of Paris nullified the sale, determining that Mr. Gentili di Giuseppe's family had been prevented from attending to the administration of the estate. Five paintings held by the Louvre were subsequently returned to the family. By February 1999 the heirs had begun pursuing individual claims regarding the other paintings in the 1941 auction and contacted the MFA about the Adoration of the Magi at that time. Because the MFA had purchased the painting before any claims were registered with the French government, the heirs affirmed that the Museum acquired the work in good faith, without knowledge that the 1941 sale was suspect. The MFA and the heirs agreed upon a part purchase / part donation settlement, through which the painting remains in the collection of the MFA.;[3] According to the catalogue accompanying the 1990 sale, the painting was ""acquired in 1941 by its current owner."

In a letter of January 24, 1992 (in MFA curatorial file), Mr. Feilchenfeldt reverses his opinion, suggesting that the picture was, rather, sold by Johanna van Gogh-Bonger in 1894-95, either to Emile Schuffenecker or to Julien Moline. Subsequently, in a letter of January 13, 2003 (in MFA curatorial file) he reintroduces the possibility that it was in Wilhelmina's possession.;[2] Letter from Guy-Patrice Dauberville, Bernheim-Jeune & Co. (March 20, 1992), it is not known when and how Josse and Gaston Bernheim-Jeune acquired the painting, nor when and how it left their possession. Walter Feilchenfeldt (letter of January 13, 2003, cited above, n. 1) has suggested that the painting may have acquired by the Bernheim-Jeune family as early as before the turn of the twentieth century. The gallery exhibited the work in 1904 and 1908, though it is not known who owned it at the time.;[3] Justice was a collector and art dealer. Madeleine Korn, ""Collecting paintings by Van Gogh in Britain before the Second World War,"" Van Gogh Museum Journal, 2002, 134-35, cites a letter from A. J. McNeill Reid to Douglas Cooper (April 9, 1953) stating that Justice ""went off to Bernheim-Jeune, got quite a few pictures on sale, bought a few more, and did a good deal of business with Boyd.;[4] Korn 2002 (as above, n. 3), 134-35, states that Justice sold this painting to Boyd. According to information provided by Frances Fowle, to be published in ""Van Gogh and Britain: Pioneer Collectors"" (Edinburgh, 2006), McNeill Reid commented in an earlier letter to Cooper (April 5, 1953) on ""a couple of Van Goghs [Boyd] bought through Justice.;Boyd lent the painting (then called ""La Charrue"" or ""The Plow"") to the ""Loan Collection of Pictures, Centenary of the Norwich Museum"" (Norwich Museum, October 24 - November 1, 1925), cat. no. 64 and to the Royal Scottish Academy (Edinburgh, 1929), cat. no. 354. However, Korn 2002 (as above, n. 3), 136, records the painting as being with C. E. Dix in 1928. She has suggested (verbally, December 14, 2005) that around this time it was with the dealer Arthur Tooth, implying that Tooth either sold it to or purchased it from Dix in 1928. This contradicts the evidence that Boyd owned it until at least 1929, and remains unconfirmed."

Recent collaborative research has revealed the lost picture beneath surface layers of paint in this view of a ravine near the asylum. For more on this discovery, see: https://www.mfa.org/collections/europe/missing-van-gogh-discovered","January, 1890, sent by the artist to his brother, Theo van Gogh (b. 1857 - d. 1891), Paris [see note 1], 1890, possibly exchanged by Theo van Gogh with Paul Gauguin (b. 1848 - d. 1903), Paris [see note 2]. By 1901, Amedée Schuffenecker (b. 1854 - d. 1936), Paris [see note 3], probably sold by Schuffenecker to Philippe Alexandre Berthier, Prince de Wagram (b. 1883 - d. 1918), Paris, between 1909 and 1912, sold by Wagram to the Galerie Barbazanges, Paris [see note 4]. By 1918, Jorgen Breder Stang (b. 1874 - d. 1950), Oslo [see note 5], by 1928, consigned by Stang to Galerie Thannhauser, Lucerne and Berlin [see note 6], 1929, sold by Thannhauser to Keith McLeod, Boston [see note 7], 1952, bequest of Keith McLeod to the MFA. (Accession Date: October 16, 1952);NOTES;[1] The MFA painting has been identified with the canvas of the ""Ravine...the study"" sent by the artist to his brother in January of 1890 (letter 834, January 3, 1890). It was included in the sixth exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants, March 20 - April 27, 1890. A closely-related composition, now at the Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, remained in the artist's possession at that time.;[2] After admiring the work at the Paris exhibition, Gauguin wrote to the artist, proposing an exchange for ""the mountain landscape"" and including a sketch of the Ravine (letter 859, March 20, 1890). It may be the ""landscape in a mauve tonality"" that Ambroise Vollard described as hanging over Gauguin's bed, see his Recollections of a Picture Dealer, trans. V. M. MacDonald (Mineola, NY, 1936, 2002), p. 174.;[3] Amédée Schuffenecker lent this painting to the exhibition “Vincent van Gogh,” Gallery Bernheim-Jeune (Paris, March 15-31, 1901). See Teio Meedendorp, ""The Schuffenecker Brothers and the Prince of Wagram,"" in The paintings of Vincent van Gogh in the collection of the Kröller-Müller Museum (Otterlo, 1998), p. 418, n. 4.;[4] The Prince de Wagram lent the painting to“Quelques oeuvres de Vincent van Gogh” (Galerie Druet, Paris January 6 – 18, 1909), cat. no. 48. Between 1909 and 1912, he divested himself of his Van Gogh paintings. On the sale to Galerie Barbazanges, see Meedendorp 1998 (as above, n. 3), p. 419, n. 19.;[5] Stang lent the picture to the exhibition ""Den Franske Utstilling"" (I Kunstnerforbundet, Oslo, January-February, 1918), cat. no. 102. The painting was exhibited, presumably by Stang, at the Leicester Galleries, November - December 1926, cat. no. 24.

In 1883-84, he executed at least twenty-eight oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors of the weavers in the district near his family's home in the Netherlands. His interest was aroused not only by the subject, but by the somber effect of the dark wood and gray walls, contrasting with the red cloth on the loom.","1884, with the artist but said to be owned by his brother, Theo van Gogh (b. 1857 - d. 1891), Paris [see note 1], 1885, probably left by the artist in Nuenen and in 1886, deposited with Adrianus Schrauwen (b. 1834 - d. 1920), Breda, 1902, sold by Schrauwen to Johannis Cornelis Couvreur and his brother, Johannes Marinus Couvreur, sold by the Couvreurs to Kees Mouwen (b. 1853 - d. 1913 or 1914), Breda, 1903, probably sold by Mouwen through Kunstzalen Oldenzeel, Rotterdam [see note 2].

(Accession Date: April 10, 1958);NOTES;[1] In a letter of about April 1, 1884, when this painting was still in progress, Vincent wrote to his brother Theo of ""studies which are your property, which I will send you if you like, but if you don't care to have them, I will ask you if I may keep them sometime, as I need them for my work. The one is a large weaver, who weaves a piece of red cloth...."" About a month later (about May 1, 1884), Vincent mentioned the painting as still being in his care.

F29 (letters no. 364 and 367).;[2] Martha Op de Coul, ""In Search of Van Gogh's Nuenen Studio,"" Van Gogh Museum Journal, 2002, p. 115, has identified the MFA painting with the Weaver exhibited at Oldenzeel from November 1 to December 13, 1903 (no. 12). This was evidently part of a group of works that Van Gogh had left in Nuenen, which were later packed and deposited with Adrianus Schrauwen, who then sold them. When they came into the possession of Kees Mouwen, they may have been owned jointly with Willem van Bakel (b. 1866), see pp. 107-109.;[3] The information about the Dekker family is taken from De la Faille, 1970 (as above, n. 1). In earlier editions of De la Faille's catalogue, Nelly Dekker is given as the earliest owner, and Mrs. C. Dekker-Fortanier is listed second.;[4] The dealer Houthakker wrote to MFA director Perry T. Rathbone (March 26, 1958) that the painting came ""from the collection of Nelly Dekker, The Hague, and her heirs."" In a subsequent letter (June 7, 1958), Houthakker mentioned other objects from the Dekker collection that he was selling."

Bayley Picture and Painting Fund,Europe,Paintings,"Tales about morally righteous women, many from the Old Testament, became popular subjects among the Protestant Dutch, who held virtue in high esteem. Goltzius’s painting recounts the story of Susanna, beautiful and pious, discovered bathing in her garden by two lecherous elders. When she spurned their advances, they claimed to have found her with a lover. Their statement was ultimately revealed at court to be a lie, and Susanna was exonerated. Here the portrait-like character of the elders’ faces is surprising. The fountain may allude to their lustful thoughts—the dolphin is a traditional symbol of expectant desire.","1671, possibly Jan de Marez, Alkmaar [see note 1].

Henderson,Europe,Paintings,"This market scene is the only known painting by Scipio Goltzius, an Antwerp-based artist from a family of engravers. In Fruit and Vegetable Vendors, the artist has closely emulated the work of Vincenzo Campi, a painter from Northern Italy, whose compositions depicting abundant fruit and vegetable stalls were in turn influenced by the older Flemish painters Pieter Aertsen and Joachim Beuckelaer. Goltzius’s Flemish and Italian predecessors used similar formats, presenting produce in the context of the marketplace with vendors and customers included in the composition. His greater emphasis on the produce, however, represents a key moment in the transition to paintings that featured only inanimate objects, a critical development for the still life. How Goltzius came into contact with Campi’s work is unknown. It is possible that Goltzius travelled to Cremona or that Campi’s paintings found their way to the prosperous port city of Antwerp.","Alvan Tufts Fuller (b. 1878 - d. 1958) and his wife, Viola Davenport Fuller (b. 1882 - d. 1959), Rye Beach, NH, by descent to their daughter, Mary Fuller Henderson (b. 1916 - d. 1989) and her husband, Robert L.

Vanitas motifs, like the skull, hourglass, candle, soap bubble, and music—represented here by the violin—served as reminders of the transitory nature of the material world. Whereas vanitas images appeared as compositional elements in other genres, these objects became the primary focus in this type of still life. The inclusion of such potent symbols in these compositions allowed the still-life genre to take on a moral significance. By painting the top right corner of the canvas as if it had come loose from its support, he demonstrated that even the painter’s canvas, which may appear to arrest time, is fragile and impermanent. In this way, the artist melded a visually striking trompe l’oeil technique—one intended to fool the eye with its illusionism—with the vanitas subject.","1953, Mortimer Brandt Gallery, New York [see note 1]. 1958, Jon Nicholas Streep, New York, 1958, sold by Streep to the MFA for $1,000.

See Sophie Lillie, Was einmal war: Handbuch der enteigneten Kunstsammlungen Wiens (Vienna: Czernin, 2003), pp. 683, 696-697, and Victoria S. Reed, ""Frans Hals, Hitler, and the Lilienfeld Collection,"" Journal of the History of Collections (2018) [doi: 10/1093/jhc/fhx035].;[4] In order to protect them, Hunna pawned this work and a painting called ""Vanitas,"" then attributed to Dou (MFA accession no. 48.1165), to the Dorotheum auction house for 15,000 RM. Both before and after it was deposited at the Dorotheum, Adolf Hitler's art advisors sought to purchase the Hals portrait for the Führermuseum, the art museum that was being planned for Linz, Austria. Officially, the painting was never acquired for the museum project and it remained in Mrs. Lilienfeld's legal possession.;[5] In 1944, the paintings were removed to the abandoned salt mines in Alt Aussee by the Austrian Monuments Protection Agency (Institut für Denkmalpflege), where they--along with other works stored by the Nazis--were to be kept safe from wartime bombing.;[6] Allied forces located the painting in the Alt Aussee mines in 1945. It remained there for several years as Mrs. Lilienfeld's attorneys sought to repay the debts to the Dorotheum, apply for export authorization, and settle other administrative matters. The paintings by Hals and the Dou were released and shipped to Mrs. Lilienfeld at the MFA in 1948."

In the early 1930s he was so committed to abstraction that he became one of the theorists of the Abstraction-Création movement, which held that abstract artworks should be derived solely from abstract forms, not from distilled representations of real things. By 1935 Hélion was moving away from strictly geometrical work, and painted a series of these faceted and sliced floating figures, which seem to hint at the human body. By decade's end Hélion had returned to figure painting almost entirely.","By 1957, Peggy Guggenheim, Venice, Italy;1957, gift of Peggy Guggenheim to the MFA. (Accession date: February 14, 1957)"

At right, a crescent on Trudl’s headband identifies her with Diana, the virgin goddess of the hunt and the moon, while at left, peacock feathers adorning her hair suggest a connection with Juno, goddess of marriage and childbirth.

(Accession Date: November 8, 1961);NOTES;[1] At the end of 1931, Kokoschka made plans to send the painting to the Moderne Galerie, Vienna, to which he offered it for sale. Correspondence between the artist and the Moderne Galerie (Archives of the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere, Vienna, Zl. 37/1932, kindly provided by Thomas Geldmacher) attests that the work was at the gallery by January, 1932, when negotiations for its purchase were underway. However, the gallery declined to buy it. Kokoschka also mentioned his hopes to sell the painting in several published letters, see ""Oskar Kokoschka, Briefe, II, 1919-1934,"" ed. Olda Kokoschka and Heinz Spielmann (Düsseldorf, 1985), letters to Alice Lahmann, late 1931, pp. 240-241 and Friedrich T. Gubler, January 9, 1932, pp. 244-245.;By March the painting was apparently on the Paris art market. In a letter to Julius Böhler (March 12, 1932, ""Oskar Kokoschka, Briefe,"" pp. 249-251) Kokoschka wrote that he had the painting at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, Paris. Bernheim-Jeune has been unable to confirm that the painting was ever at the gallery.;The painting was exhibited in the summer of that year at the 18th Biennale Exhibition, Venice. The exhibition catalogue states that it belonged to the National Gallery, Dresden. Dr. Birgit Dalbajewa, Galerie Neuer Meister, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (correspondence of May 9, 2005) attests that the painting was never in the possession of the National Gallery, but suggests that it might have been lent from Dresden. Hans Posse, at that time the director of the National Gallery of Dresden, curated the Biennale and negotiated the loans. Moreover, Franz Kochmann, a Dresden resident, owned the painting by 1935, it is possible that he acquired it at about this time, lending it to the Biennale through the National Gallery. See below, n. 2.;[2] Edith Hoffmann, ""Kokoschka: Life and Work"" (Boston, 1947), p. 330, cat. no. 246, first published the painting as being in the collection of Franz Kochmann, who emigrated from Dresden to Utrecht in 1940. He had lent the painting to the ""Ausstellung"" (exhibition) held at the Kunsthaus, Zurich, April 18 - May 15, 1935, cat. no. 99, a loan negotiated by Hans Posse of the National Gallery, Dresden.;As indicated by documents issued by the Gemeentemuseum and currently housed in the Municipal Archive of the City of the Hague (file no. 108), on April 4, 1940, Mr. Kochmann deposited several works of art -- including this painting -- at the Gemeentemuseum, the Hague. On May 2, 1946, the Gemeentemuseum returned the painting to him. Correspondence from Hans Janssen, curator, Gemeentemuseum (March 15, 2005) confirms this. Copies of the Gemeentemuseum documents, from 1940 and 1946, are in the MFA curatorial file.;[3] Hans Maria Wingler, ""Oskar Kokoschka: das Werk des Malers"" (Salzburg, 1956), p. 321, cat. no. 262 (as in a private collection, Stuttgart).

Kokoschka's haunted expression and the ambiguous poses of the two lovers—who seem both to embrace and to move past each other—reflect a complex and tormented relationship. Kokoschka's bold brushwork and Expressionist style were influenced not only by van Gogh but by the sixteenth-century Spanish painter El Greco, whose work Kokoschka greatly admired.","July, 1913, sold by the artist to Franz Hauer (b. 1867 – d. 1914), Vienna [see note 1].

Tobias G. Natter, Die Welt von Klimt, Schiele und Kokoschka: Sammler und Mäzene (Cologne, 2003), 254, suggests he acquired the painting around 1914/1915. It was first published as being in Dr. Reichel's collection by Paul Westheim in Das Kunstblatt 1 (1917), p. 319.;[3] On February 1, 1939, Reichel transferred the painting--along with four other Kokoschka paintings--to the dealer Otto Kallir, who at that time ran the Galerie St. Etienne in Paris. Kallir exhibited it in Paris that spring and brought it to the United States later that year. After his arrival in the United States, he paid Reichel's two sons, who had already immigrated to North and South America, for the paintings.

His many small portraits of actors and dancers were avidly collected by contemporaries. This sitter likely sits before a theatrical backdrop, showing her “well-turned ankle,” and may well be connected with the stage. Elaborately dressed, she bears a close resemblance to Mlle Marie Sallé (1707–1756), a dancer and choreographer whom Voltaire (1694–1778) praised for her expressive gracefulness. Like many of Lancret’s works, this painting is heavily influenced by the genre scenes of elegant figures in garden settings popularized by his contemporary Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684–1721).","Before 1937, Samuel Reading Bertron (b. 1865 - d. 1938), New York, by descent to his daughter, Elizabeth Bertron Fahnestock (Mrs. Wladimir W.

(Accession Date: January 2, 1950);NOTES;[1] This biccherna, or account book cover, was recorded by Galgano Bichi in Siena in 1724, see L. Borgia et al., Le Biccherne: Tavole Dipinte delle Magistrature Senesi (Secoli XIII-XVIII) (Rome, 1984), p. 112, cat. no. 36. It was probably dispersed in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century.;[2] Published in Ramboux's collection catalogue of 1862, no. 21. See A. Geffroy, ""Tablettes Inédites de la Biccherna et de la Gabella de Sienne,"" Mélanges d'Archéologie et d'Histoire 2 (1882), p. 419.;[3] In 1949, when the MFA first considered acquiring the panel, its owner wrote to Walter Schatzki, the dealer through whom it was offered (November 14, 1949). According to a transcript of this letter (which is unsigned, but must have been written by Max Neunzert, as discussed below), ""this painting formerly belonged to my good friend Karl Anton Reichel. I obtained the painting from him in Munich in 1931 upon my return from China, since he then found himself in financial difficulties."" An authentication of the painting by Georg Swarzenski of February 28, 1933 is, however, addressed to Reichel, which suggests that it was still in his possession at that time. The painting was probably in Reichel's possession in February 1931, as well, when it was authenticated in Munich by Wilhelm Suida.;[4] As discussed above (n. 3), despite the letter attesting that the sale took place in 1931, the authentication of the painting by Swarzenski in 1933 suggests that it was in Reichel's possession at that time. It was certainly in Max Neunzert's possession by July 24, 1934, when it was authenticated by Hanna Gräff on behalf of her husband, Dr. Walter Gräff, and Neunzert was named as the owner. Neunzert later attested that he took the panel to Switzerland in 1934 (see below, Additional Information).;[5] According to his letter to Walter Schatzki (as above, n. 3), Neunzert ""deposited the painting -- when I was forced to flee Munich on account of my anti-Nazi activities -- in Switzerland, and in 1943 put it up for sale at the Galerie Fischer in Lucerne. It is listed in the Fischer catalogue for that year. I did not sell it because of the low price it made."" Correspondence from Kuno Fischer, Galerie Fischer, to the MFA (February 18, 2004) indicates that the consignor of the painting was Mrs. Dr. Zellweger of Zurich. Whether Neunzert consigned it to Fischer under a pseudonym, or whether he had entrusted the panel to a Mrs. Zellweger, is not known.;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION;Max Neunzert was a member of the Nazi party in the 1920s. The statements that he made to Walter Schatzki in 1949 (see above, n. 3) can be corroborated with what is known of his life. In 1929 Neunzert traveled to China to help spread National Socialism, he returned to Munich in 1931. Like Carl Anton Reichel, he fought for the restoration of the monarchy in Germany. Upon his return from China in 1931, he realized this would not be possible under Hitler, and he left the party. Thereafter he fought actively against the Nazis. He assumed names including ""Max Keck"" and ""Mr. Donau"" and was exiled in Switzerland during the 1940s. For more on Neunzert, see Carlos Collado Seidel, ""In geheimer Mission für Hitler und die bayerische Staatsregierung. Der politische Abenteurer Max Neunzert zwischen Fememorden, Hitler-Pusch und Berlin-Krise,"" Vierteljarshefte für Zeitgeschichte 50, no. 2 (April, 2002): 201-236.;In a signed statement of January 20, 1948, written from Flims-Waldhaus, Max Neunzert attested that the painting was not Nazi loot: ""I herewith declare on oath that the Biccherna panel was legally acquired by me at that time and, therefore, is not Nazi looted property. In order to deny the Nazis access to it, as early as 1934 I was able to bring the panel into Switzerland.;The MFA has no indication that the panel was improperly transferred or stolen during the Nazi era."

Bayley Picture and Painting Fund,Europe,Paintings,"Van Loon’s large canvas depicts the New Testament episode in which shepherds discover the Christ Child in the manger—a subject that allowed the artist to emphasize the revelation of Christ’s divinity. Van Loon spent most of his career in Brussels and executed commissions for local churches seeking striking paintings with recognizable subjects that would reinvigorate the faith of Catholics after the Protestant Reformation.

In this work, the artist emphasized calm resolution by depicting the travelers after the miracle rather than during it, possibly to symbolize the Church's deliverance of spiritual refreshment to humanity. Although a prolific printmaker, Lucas van Leyden made only about fifteen paintings. Painting with tempera on linen, as in this work, was considered a less-expensive alternative to tapestry decoration, but the medium has proven susceptible to darkening over time.","By 1657, Borghese family, Rome [see note 1], by descent within the family to Agnese Borghese (b. 1836 - d. 1920), Principessa di Piombino, Rome [see note 2]. 1900, with Julius Böhler, Munich. 1900, acquired on the Munich art market by the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg [see note 3], 1954, sold by the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, through the Schaeffer Galleries, New York (stock no. 1563), to the MFA for $135,000 [see note 4].

These paintings came to the Munich Central Collecting Point from Alt Aussee (no. 4095), and were numbered 8875. This information is taken from inventory card 1557 A-B, Stichting Nederlandsch Kunstbezit Archive, no. 846, and Munich Central Collecting Point inventory card, National Archives and Records Administration, College Park, MD (Proprty Card 8875, Microfilm M1946, Reel 50).;[6] After World War II, the Stichting Nederlandsch Kunstbezit (SNK, Foundation for Netherlandish Art Property) was assigned the task of recuperating looted artworks from abroad and returning them to their rightful owners in the Netherlands.;[7] The panels were mistakenly believed to have come from the collection of O. Lanz of Amsterdam. For this reason, they were not returned to David Goldmann immediately following the war, but were taken to the Netherlands along with other works of art destined for restitution by the SNK (letter from Rudolf E. O. Ekkart, Head of the Origins Unknown Project (Bureau Herkomst Gezocht), The Hague, August 17, 2004).;[8] This information was made available through the generous assistance of Arno van Os, registrar at the Museum Catharijneconvent, Utrecht (letter of May 13, 2004). On February 21, 1952 the Archbishop Museum received a letter from the Bureau Herstelbetalings- en Recuperatiegoederen requesting the return of the panels to David Goldmann and on March 10 they left the museum for restitution to him. The panels were listed among the works still missing from Mr. Goldmann's collection in the Verzeichnisse gesuchter Kunstwerke aus österreichischem Besitz (n.d., [1950?]). Their restitution in 1952 to David Goldmann's family has been confirmed in a signed statement by his daughter (May 10, 2004), as well as in a letter from her to the MFA (June 26, 2004).;[9] According to the letter from Mr. Goldmann's daughter (as above, n. 8).;[10] According to an interoffice memorandum (September 20, 1981, in the MFA curatorial file)."

(Accession Date: April 27, 2005);NOTES;[1] The earliest recorded account of the altarpiece at Calenberg Castle is that of M. Heinrich Bünting (Braunschweigische Chronik, 1584). He specifies that the donors represented in the main panel are Princess Katharina and Duke Erich, the coats-of-arms confirm this. For Bunting's account, see endnote below, this is taken from the German transcription by Bernhard Hausmann, Verzeichniss der Hausmann'schen Gemählde-Sammlung in Hannover (Hanover, 1831), pp. 123-24, footnote. Katharina died in 1524, suggesting the altarpiece had been commissioned by that date.;[2] In 1636 Georg von Braunschweig-Calenberg moved the seat of power to the city of Hanover (subsequently, Calenberg Castle was abandoned and, in 1690, torn down). Presumably the altarpiece was moved to the new princely residence at this time.;[3] Hausmann 1831 (see above and below, nn. 1 and 4) states that he found the altarpiece in pieces in Hanover in 1811, that is, during the French occupation of the city (1803-1813). During this time, Leine Castle was occupied by French troops and plundered. The altarpiece must have been dismantled and discarded or sold as a consequence.;[4] Hausmann described the altarpiece in his collection catalogue of 1831, see Hausmann 1831 (as above, n. 1), pp. 123-125, cat. no. 215a-c. He states that in 1811 he discovered the altarpiece in pieces in two junk shops in Hannover, saved them, and made them part of his collection.;[5] In 1857, Hausmann closed his gallery and sold the collection to Georg V. See Klaus Mlynek, ""Von Privaten zum Öffentlichen - Erste Museumsgründungen in der Residenzstadt Hannover,"" in 100 Jahre Kestner-Museum Hannover, 1889-1989, ed. Ulrich Gehrig (Hanover: Das Museum, 1989), 170.;[6] In 1861, Georg V used the works of art he purchased from Hausmann -- as well as other objects in the family's possession -- as the basis for the Welfenmuseum, the contents of which were entailed, or owned by and inherited within the family. In 1901 these objects formed the basis for the Fideikommissgalerie (""entailed gallery"") at the Provinzialmuseum, Hanover. There the Calenberg Altarpiece was inventory no. 423. In 1924, it was removed by the family to their residence at the Schloss Blankenburg, Harz. This move coincided with the reorganization of the Provinzialmuseum, when parts of the Fideikommissgalerie were removed (and some were sold). In 1945, the family left Blankenburg and took its contents to the Schloss Marienburg, Hanover.

The Princess is painted in her raiment, as it was customary at that time, with bare neck and chest, adorned with precious jewels, gemstones and golden chains, and so her Princely Grace's ladies-in-waiting are sitting beside her, also dressed in the same manner.;Duke Eric the Elder sits facing her on the other side, painted in his entire cuirass, with a long brown velvet mantle, in a red velvet cap, adorned with a handsome long white feather. And even though the painting is rather old, still one sees indeed even so still unto this very day, that it must have been a very beautiful panel, upon which the Princess is in particular very painstakingly painted, with her lovely countenance and beautiful red cheeks."

Correspondence from Betty Mont to Kenneth Donahue, Director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (August 29, 1968) reveals that Mont had purchased the painting from Baroness Isbary's daughter, Princess Windisch-Grätz. Presumably, it was Princess Windisch-Grätz or her mother who had lent the painting to the exhibition organized by P. de Boer, Amsterdam and Galerie Sanct Lucas, Vienna (of which Mont was director), ""Die Jüngeren Brueghel und ihr Kreis"" (Vienna, Palais Pallavicini, March 16 - April 15, 1935).;In a letter of September 19, 1968, Mrs. Mont wrote to Mr. Donahue that around 1912 Princess Windisch-Grätz's grandfather had purchased the Schloss Friedau (Austria), including about three-quarters of its large painting collection.

In the winter of 1892 the artist spent several months studying and painting the façade of Rouen Cathedral in his native Normandy. From rooms facing the cathedral across a square, Monet concentrated on the analysis of light and its effects on the forms of the façade, changing from one canvas to another as the day progressed. Later he extensively reworked the thirty paintings of the cathedral series in his studio at Giverny. Their encrusted surfaces of dry, thickly layered paint evoke the rough texture of weathered stone, absorbing and reflecting light like the walls of the cathedral itself.","1907, sold by the artist to Durand-Ruel, Paris and New York (stock no. 3327), 1917, sold by Durand-Ruel to Hannah Marcy Edwards (d. 1929), Boston, by inheritance to Grace M.

He is said to have kept goats, dogs, foxes, horses, squirrels, guinea pigs, and dormice in his garden in the early 1790s.","1940, Miss Amelia Peabody, Boston;1940, gift of Miss Amelia Peabody.

By comparison, this frontal view of Ingeborg Onsager appears serene. The wife of a fellow Norwegian painter, Onsager modeled regularly for Munch—her round face and wide-set eyes are often recognizable in his prints and paintings. For all its composure, the picture still exhibits the intense color and bold brushwork that made Munch a hero for artists of the next generation. He likely painted it in 1912, the year when a major retrospective in Cologne introduced his work to such young German artists as Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, providing inspiration for the Expressionist movement.","1913, sold in Stockholm [see note 1]. 1913 until 1916, Carl Steinbart, Berlin. 1916, Galerie Thannhauser, Munich (stock no. 4268) [see note 2].

In the late 1880s, Munch conceived an epic series of paintings entitled The Frieze of Life, which dealt poetically and symbolically with life, love, and death. Many of his most memorable images were part of this ultimately unfinished project. Summer Night's Dream, the first work in the cycle of Love, portrays the initial glimmer of adolescent sexual awakening. Bathed in an eerie light, the painting is probably set in the Borre Forest, a traditional place of courtship during Norway's long midsummer nights.","Sold by the artist to Professor Helge Bäckström (b. 1865 - d. 1932) and his wife Rägnhild Bäckström (b. 1871 - d. 1908), Stockholm, Sweden [see note 1]. 1924, with Galerie Commeter, Hamburg [see note 2]. 1926, Paul Cassirer, Berlin [see note 3].

An old photograph of the painting exists in Lebel's photographic archive, it is annotated on the back: ""Eglon van der Neer.;[6] Robert Lebel visited the MFA on October 8, 1943 and told curator W. G. Constable that he had sold this painting to Walter Westfeld around 1937. According to a letter from Walter Westfeld's brother to the MFA (February 6, 1944), Lebel had written to him in the fall of 1943 as well, stating that around 1935/1936 he had sold the painting to Westfeld, who had it at the Galerie Kleucker and ""at a time, in Amsterdam."" A painting described as a Company Scene by Eglon van der Neer, which is probably the present painting, was exhibited at the Galerie August Kleucker, Düsseldorf, in mid-May, 1936.;[7] A photograph of the painting, supplied to the MFA by Silberman, bears W. R. Valentiner's authentication on the reverse, dated May 15, 1941. The painting was first offered to the MFA on June 3, 1941. A subsequent letter from dealer Abris Silberman to W. G. Constable of the MFA (June 3, 1942) states that ""the painting was brought to this country by a refugee some time ago"" but had never been in a U.S. collection. Attempts to determine when and how Silberman acquired the work have not been successful.;ADDITIONAL INFORMATION;In 1920 Walter Westfeld opened a gallery that bore his name in Elberfeld (present-day Wuppertal). However, under the Nazi regime he was forced to discontinue his business because he was Jewish, the Galerie Walter Westfeld officially closed on May 27, 1936. Several months later, his associate August Kleucker was put in charge of liquidating the gallery stock through the Galerie Kleucker in Düsseldorf. It is not known whether this painting had formed part of Westfeld's gallery stock or whether he owned it privately, thus it is not known if it was part of the 1936 liquidation through Kleucker. In the fall of 1937, Westfeld was forced to turn over to the Gestapo a list of all the works of art still in his possession, the Van der Neer does not appear on this list. Whether it was no longer in Westfeld's possession at this time, or had been deliberately left off the list, is uncertain.;In November 1938 Westfeld was arrested for foreign exchange violations. He was subsequently found guilty of having -- after the closure of his gallery -- illegally shipped works of art and other assets abroad, to Paris and Amsterdam, and of continuing to sell his own works of art through Kleucker. Whether the Van der Neer left his possession in one of these ways is not known. According to correspondence from a family member to the MFA (November 11, 2004), Westfeld had paintings and other valuables at the Rotterdamse Wisselbank in Amsterdam as late as 1939, again, it is not known if the Van der Neer could have been among these. The valuables were apparently taken unlawfully and sold during World War II, and remain untraced.;In 1939 Nazi authorities seized Westfeld's remaining art assets in Germany and auctioned them through Lempertz, Cologne, on December 12-13, 1939. The Van der Neer painting was not included in this sale.;After Westfeld's trial in Nazi Germany, he served a prison sentence at Lüttringhausen. In 1942 he was sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp and, in 1943, to Auschwitz. He was declared deceased at the end of World War II.;In June, 2011 the MFA reached a financial settlement with the heirs and the estate of Walter Westfeld for the Portrait of a Man and Woman in an Interior, allowing the work to remain at the museum. This was based on a review of the above research, which outlines a limited number of ways the painting could have left his possession. It seems unlikely that Westfeld gave or sold the painting voluntarily after the closure of his gallery in May, 1936. Rather, as a Jewish art dealer living in Nazi Germany, he probably disposed of it due to persecution.;Bibliography: Herbert Schmidt, Der Elendsweg der Düsseldorfer Juden: Chronologie des Schreckens, 1933-1945 (Düsseldorf: Droste, 2005), pp. 273-278, Victoria S.

This painting is one of two faithful iterations created by the little-known Dijon artist Pierre Nichon. There is no firm evidence indicating the reason for the great popularity of the image, although the dramatic use of light and the naturalistic depiction of the carp are certainly arresting. It is likely that the composition had symbolic significance. As a common symbol for Christ, the fish probably refers to the Eucharist, and the smoldering candle alludes to the transience of human life. Through the combination of these motifs, the painting arguably depicts Christian redemption without the inclusion of traditional Catholic religious symbols. Such an image may have resonated strongly with the relatively small Protestant minority in Alsace.","Art dealer, Dijon, by 1951, sold by the dealer to Jean Neger, Paris, sold by Neger to an unknown art dealer [see note 1].

Ms. Ducluzeau indicated that Neger said he acquired the painting from a small dealer in Dijon and sold it to another dealer. In a letter to the MFA (July 26, 1964), Dirk Hannema said that he recalled seeing ""two still lifes of the same subject with the art dealer Neger"" in 1949, but he did not identify either one with the MFA composition. He also said he believed that the MFA painting was once in the R. Payelle collection, a suggestion which has been repeated in literature on the picture. However, the Payelle painting was sold November 23, 1972, Palais Galliera, Paris, lot 46, and therefore cannot be identical with the one at the MFA, acquired in 1963.

The practice of scrutinizing the unique markings and imperfections of an actual object and attempting to recreate them on canvas was popularized by still life artists working in Italy in the late sixteenth century, most notably by Caravaggio. This later still life is attributed to the Tuscan painter, Pietro Paolini, who studied with one of Caravaggio’s followers. In addition to the botanical accuracy described above, the strong contrast of light and shade, the use and form of the vase, and the monochromatic background are all Caravaggesque. The painter artfully contrasts the more haphazard array of fruits and leaves strewn across the ledge with the relatively static arrangement of the flowers in the vase.","Anonymous collection, Turin. 1938, Matthiesen, Ltd., London, October 1938, sold by Matthiesen to M.

The gallery's shipping papers from March 19, 1937, note that it was purchased from Manley on February 13 (year illegible, presumably 1937), Manley also wrote to Seligmann on April 3, 1937, regarding the payment of interest on the painting. It is possible that Barret-Décap sold the work to Seligmann through Manley, that the two men owned it jointly, or that Manley owned the work for a very short period of time, around February 9-13, 1937.;[3] De Hauke was a sales representative for Jacques Seligmann and Co. While he purchased works of art that were sold by the gallery, the ownership of the objects was often officially shared by several art dealers, and the transactions became quite complicated.

Renoir gives the girls—their bonnets elaborately ruffled and ribboned—the fanciful air of shepherdesses in a rococo pastoral, taking his cue from the 18th-century artist François Boucher and his airy, make-believe scenes.

However, in 1998, Durand-Ruel (as above, n. 1) provided the MFA with a copy of notes from their archives (July 26, 1923), indicating that the New York branch of the gallery acquired the painting in 1897 and sold it to Mrs. A. S. Coburn in 1923. The stock and photograph numbers identified with the painting sold to Mrs. Coburn are also found on the reverse of the MFA painting's original stretcher. It is therefore likely that in 1924, the MFA composition was confused with another painting and an incorrect provenance was provided."

Vollard's estate was divided between his brother, Lucian, and his friend, Mme. de Galea. Lucian sold much of his share of the collection -- including 429 paintings, drawings, and watercolors by Renoir -- to the dealer Martin Fabiani. When Fabiani attempted to ship the pictures to the United States via Bermuda, they were considered suspect due to their country of origin (in 1940 France came under German military occupation). They were seized, held in Canada, and released to Fabiani on May 30, 1949. Meanwhile, the city of Paris, to which Vollard had bequeathed four paintings for the Petit Palais, claimed it had some rights to the rest of the collection as well, and brought action against the Vollard estate. In 1949, the French courts decided in favor of the Vollard heirs, ensuring that Fabiani was the legal owner of the pictures in his possession. See Lynn H.

(Accession Date: February 13, 1941);NOTES;[1] According to a letter from the Brussels art dealer P. Christyn to the Antwerp art merchant Matthijs Musson (December 16, 1643), an unidentified man had recently purchased six large Rubens paintings from the ""Hof,"" or palace of the dukes of Brabant in Brussels. Among these was ""the head of Cyrus which is being presented to a queen, with many accompanying figures, that is very well painted."" The six paintings were probably owned by the Infanta Isabella and were passed along at her death to the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria, then sold after his death in 1641. See Robert W. Berger, ""Rubens's 'Queen Tomyris with the Head of Cyrus,'"" MFA Bulletin 77 (1979): 11-12. He suggests that Isabella commissioned the painting around 1622/23 as an allegory of her power and virtue (see pp. 22-23).;[2] Musson drew up a stock of paintings that were to be offered for sale to Amalia von Solms (October 26, 1645), designated ""pictures which come from the Infant[e]"", that is, Ferdinand of Austria and which included ""a picture of King Cyrus whose head is placed in his blood, with fifteen figures, quite pleasant, by Rubens, life size."" See Berger 1979 (as above, n. 1), p. 11. In the MFA picture are fifteen clearly legible figures (two armored guards obscured at the right, which may account for the discrepancy).;[3] The painting was listed in inventories of Queen Christina's collection in Rome in 1662 (probable date of document), 1688, and 1689. Five of the six Rubens paintings named in Christyn's 1643 letter (cited above, note 1) ended up in Queen Christina's collection. See Berger 1979 (as above, n. 1), p. 14.;[4] Christina bequeathed her collection to her close friend, Cardinal Decio Azzolino. He died only months after she did, leaving the collection to his nephew, who sold nearly all of it.;[5] Philippe d'Orléans sought to acquire Queen Christina's collection of paintings as early as 1714, when he first sent Crozat to Rome to negotiate a purchase. The contract for sale was not drawn up until 1721.;[6] Thomas Moore Slade, Baron George Kinnaird, and Mr. Morland and Mr. Hammersley sought to acquire the entire Orléans collection of paintings as early as June, 1792, but were unsuccessful. Subsequently, after the Italian paintings had been sold, Slade returned to Paris to negotiate the purchase of the Dutch and Flemish pictures. His offer was accepted and he took the paintings with him to England, where he sold them privately in 1793. See William Buchanan, Memoirs of Painting (London, 1824), vol. 1, 159 - 164.;[7] Lord Darnley lent the painting to the exhibition ""L'art belge au XVIIe siècle,"" (Brussels, June - November, 1910), cat. no. 407. In 1914, the MFA considered purchasing the painting through Richard Norton, at that time in England, Norton acted as an art expert on behalf of the museum. He wrote to MFA director Arthur Fairbanks (March 12, 1914) that Lord Darnley was preparing to sell some of his pictures and recommended the Rubens painting of Queen Tomyris with the Head of Cyrus for the museum. However, the trustees declined to purchase it.;[8] According to a letter from Robert Langton Douglas to Charles C. Cunningham of the MFA (June 25, 1941, in MFA curatorial file). Douglas did not specify whether it was acquired directly from the Darnley family."

The description of the Rubens painting in the two Pauwels sale catalogues matches the appearance of the MFA painting in its overpainted state. Its dimensions (97 x 78 cm.), however, do not. In Rubens: The Ceiling Decoration of the Banqueting Hall, Corpus Rubenianum Ludwig Burchard series, pt. 15 (London: Harvey Miller, 2005), vol. 1, cat. no. 3g, p. 181, Gregory Martin suggests that when it was in the Pauwels collection, the MFA panel was enlarged to allow for a mountainous landscape, this would account for the discrepancy in dimensions. Martin further suggests that the ""additions may have been executed for the most part on paper laid down on panel,"" which would explain an annotation found next to the lot description in the 1814 sale catalogue: ""faux et peint sur papier"". If the MFA composition was enlarged, such additions were removed by 1881, when the painting was in the Beurnonville sale and its dimensions recorded as 65 x 52 cm.;[2] A wax seal on the reverse of the panel indicates that the painting was in the Sedelmeyer collection.;[3] Max Rooses, ""L'oeuvre de P.

Sisley moved there in 1871 after his home and studio in the neighboring town of Bougival were sacked by advancing Prussian troops. Representing snowy rooftops, smoking chimneys, and trudging pedestrians, this scene evokes the chilly atmosphere of rural France in the année terrible (terrible year) of the Franco-Prussian War.","By 1892, M.

Mr. von Tschudi was a close friend of the Durand-Ruel family, as well as an avid collector of Impressionist painting. He served as Director of the National Gallery, Berlin from 1896 to 1909.;[3] The Sisley was one of five paintings deaccessioned by the National Gallery and exchanged with dealer Fritz Nathan for Caspar David Friedrich's ""Man and Woman Looking at the Moon.""

The latter source cites information from Fritz Nathan's son Peter, according to whom the Sisley was sold by his father to Paul Rosenberg, who then gave the painting to the MFA. This is at least partially incorrect, as the painting came to the MFA in the bequest of John Taylor Spaulding, who had purchased it from Tooth. Fritz Nathan did however state that he sold the painting through Feilchenfeldt to Rosenberg, see his Erinnerungen aus meinem Leben (Zurich, 1965), p. 90. At the time Spaulding purchased it from Tooth, it was planned for inclusion in a Sisley exhibition to be held at Paul Rosenberg's gallery in Paris in the spring of 1939, but whether Rosenberg continued to hold any ownership in the work at that time is not known.;[4] According to D. Corcoran of Reid and Lefevre (letter to the MFA, October 9, 1967), Gérard lent the painting to the exhibition ""Pissarro and Sisley,"" Reid and Lefevre Gallery, London, January 1937, cat. no. 15. Whether Gérard owned it at this time is not certain. A letter from Dudley Tooth of Tooth and Sons (May 20, 1939) says that the painting ""passed into my hands by the dealer who made the exchange"" with the National Gallery in Berlin."

A domestic scene of mirth and noise, recommended by diversity and strength of character and infinite humour. The execution is in his most vigorous style. Truly capital.""

It has been determined that these two canvases (church of San Martino, Nespoledo, near Udine, 161 x 130 cm. and Museo Civico, Padua, 74 x 114 cm.) were never part of a single composition (Lucio Zambon, Conservator, oral communication, October 1, 2004), but were created separately, probably after the original by Strozzi had been divided. Strozzi's canvas, therefore, was most likely divided before Stroiffi's death in 1693, either by Strozzi himself or by an early owner of his work. A technical examination of the stretchers confirms that the canvas had been cut by the late 18th to mid-19th century.;[2] The upper fragment was reproduced, without indication of its location, by Orlando Grosso, ""Note ed appunti su Bernardo Strozzi,"" Rassegna d'Arte 9 (1922): p. 158. Luisa Mortari, ""Bernardo Strozzi"" (Rome, 1966), p. 132, fig. 126, also reproduced it and gave its location as a private collection, Genoa. The dates that it was in this collection, however, are not known. The link between the painting reproduced by Grosso and Mortari and the MFA's painting of St. Sebastian (1972.83) was first proposed by Barry Hannegan, ""Strozzi's Saint Sebastian,"" MFA Bulletin 71, no. 364 (1973), p. 66.;[3] This information was supplied by Georg Rehm. How and when the Bader family came into possession of the painting is not known. It may have been purchased from Kurt Bösch (b. 1907 - d. 2000) of Augsburg, from whom the Baders acquired other works of art, though this is not certain.;[4] Attributed in the catalogue to an Italian artist, about 1800."

Here, the woman engages the viewer as a participant in the action by her direct glance out of the picture. The event is a ""high-life circus,"" in which the amateur performers were members of the aristocracy.","1885, with Galerie Sedelmeyer, Paris. 1886, with Arthur Tooth and Son, London [see note 1]. 1889, E.

He exploited the texture of the fabric as well as the three-dimensional properties of oil paint to create broken strokes and bold touches. In this portrait, Titian’s red-haired sitter is unidentified, but his book and sword proclaim his learning and noble status. He wears an ostentatious costume with prominent slashes, decorative aglets, and cuffs and collar dotted with pearls. Unlike Titian, he probably wasn’t Venetian—Venetian men of this period preferred solid colored robes.","Until 1650, possibly the Oneto family, Genoa [see note 1], 1650, possibly brought by Don Giovan Stefano Oneto and Don Agostino Oneto from Genoa to Palermo, Sicily, by descent within the Oneto family to Don Giuseppe Oneto e Lanza (d. 1852), Duke of Sperlinga, Palermo and Naples, 1864, sold by the heirs of Oneto e Lanza to the Count of Francavilla, Palermo, by descent to his son, Luigi Maria Majorca Mortillaro, Count of Francavilla, Palermo, who owned it until at least 1901 [see note 1].

Painted when he was nearly eighty with the help of his studio, this picture shows Saint Catherine surrounded by her attributes: the torturer’s wheel, broken by divine intervention, the sword with which she was beheaded, and the palm, a symbol of martyrdom. In addition to much of the kneeling figure, some elements seem worthy of Titian himself, such as the splendid red curtain and the burst of light amid the clouds at upper right. He delegated other sections, particularly the tiled floor and the unconvincing arch, to assistants.","1567 until 1598, Cardinal Alessandrino Farnese (Michele di Bonelli) (b. 1541 - d. 1598), Rome [see note 1]. 1653, Manuel de Acevedo y Zúñiga (b. about 1590 - d. 1653), 6th Count of Monterrey, Madrid [see note 2], 1653, transferred to Gaspar de Haro y Guzmán (b. 1629 - d. 1687), 7th Marqués de Carpio, Madrid [see note 3], 1691, possibly transferred from the Haro y Guzmán collection to the Spanish Royal Collection, Real Monasterio del Escorial (?), Madrid [see note 4]. 1825, William Waldegrave (b. 1753 - d. 1825), 1st Baron Radstock, Longford Castle, Wiltshire, England, May 12-13, 1826, Radstock sale, Christie's, London, lot 39, to Charles Dixon [see note 5], by descent at Dixon's death to his nephew, George Wilder, Stansted Park, Hampshire, England, May 19, 1911, Wilder sale, Christie's, London, lot 37, to ""Arthur"", probably Arthur L.

The cardinal's posthumous 1598 inventory mentions ""Una Santa Caterina della Rota inginocchiata con un crucifisso, fatto di mano di Titiano, stimate: scudi 40"" (A Saint Catherine of the Wheel, kneeling, with a crucifix, done by the hand of Titian, estimated at 40 scudi).;[2] Manuel de Acevedo y Zúñiga's posthumous inventory of April 19, 1653, lists (no. 69): ""Una Santa Cathalina Arrodillada delante de un Santo xp.to de tiçiano Con Su moldura de Nogal tocada de oro.""

It is possible that the Titian listed in Zúñiga's 1653 inventory is identical with no. 155 in that of Gaspar de Haro: ""Un lienço de Una pintura de St.a Catt.a que esta haziendo oraccion a Un SS.to xpo. en frente de Un arbol [arco] de Una prespetiva y tiene Un manto azul arodillada S.re Un pecado de la Rueda que esta Junto a Una espada de mano del tiçiano de mas de Vara de ancho y Una y media de Cayda con su marco negro.""

Burke and Cherry (as above, n. 2), document 115, pp. 831, 859, no. 561. This description does not exactly match that of the painting at the MFA, however, the catalogue of the Radstock sale (1826) notes that the MFA painting came from the Escorial. If the MFA painting is the same as the Titian listed in Gaspar de Haro's 1689 inventory, its movement to the Escorial would be more easily explained.;[5] Information about Charles Dixon and the inheritance of his estate by his nephew is taken from notes in the MFA curatorial file by E.

Painted during Velázquez's first trip to court, this portrait may well have led to his first royal commission and swift appointment as a court painter. Gongora, one of Spain's leading poets, had become cynical and embittered during his years at court. The painter shapes his formidable head with broad, smoothly blended brushstrokes that create both the form and texture of Gongora's features, his tight, downturned mouth, and guarded gaze.","1622, painted in Madrid, probably at the request of Francisco Pacheco (b. 1564 - d. 1644) [see note 1]. 1660, probably with the artist [see note 2].

Although Pacheco asked Velázquez to paint the portrait, its early history has not been established.

The hunter Actaeon has stumbled upon the goddess of the hunt, Diana, bathing with her nymphs—her arrows and their clothes have been discarded at right. As punishment for gazing upon their nudity, Diana transforms Actaeon into a stag and he is torn apart by his own dogs. Typically this story is rendered with Actaeon expressing shock, here, however, he lounges on a rock, apparently enjoying the scene before he suffers the consequences.","Until 1657, Giovanni Batta Raggi (b. 1613 - d. 1657), Genoa [see note 1], 1658, by inheritance to his brother, Cardinal Lorenzo Raggi (b. 1615 - d. 1687), Rome [see note 2], until at least 1780, probably by descent within the family, to Giulio Raggi, Genoa [see note 3], 1818, possibly still at the Raggi palace, Genoa [see note 4].

Palazzo Ducale, Genoa, March 20 - July 11, 2004, pp. 325-26, nos. 51-55 and p. 372, cat. nos. 94a-c). Of these, four are at the MFA (accession nos. 59.260, 60.125, 64.2078, 64.2079) and the fifth, showing the Rape of Europa, is in the Rasini collection, Milan.;[2] The paintings are also included in a list, dated November 6, 1658, of works of art to be sent to Raggi's brother in Rome, see Boccardo, ed., 2004 (as above, n. 1), p. 326 (""Cinque bislonghi di Paolo [Veronese]"").;[3] After the death of Lorenzo, one painting by Veronese probably remained in Rome, with his cousin Sigismondo, although it is not known which, Sigismondo lent a bislungo, or painting of elongated format, to San Salvatore in Lauro in 1701 and 1710. The others were sent back to Genoa and are recorded in 1780 at the palace of Giulio Raggi, trisnipote (probably a great-grandson or -nephew) of Giovanni Batta. They are described simply as ""diverse fregi con piccole figure di Paolo da Verona"" (different friezes [i.e., paintings of a long format] with little figures by Paolo Veronese).;[4] In 1818, three of the five paintings -- the Rape of Europa and two that are not specified by subject -- were recorded at the palace by an anonymous author (""Descrizione della città di Genova da un anonimo del 1818,"" p. 303).;[5] According to information supplied by the Getty Provenance Index, Holford lent this picture to the Royal Academy Winter Exhibition, Burlington House, London, 1902 (cat. no. 114). He may well have inherited the painting from his father, Robert Holford (b. 1808 - d. 1892), who was an avid collector. When Gustav Waagen visited Dorchester House in 1851, however, he did not record this in the Holford collection.;[6] The information on Agnew's transactions was supplied by the Getty Provenance Index."

The first to strike the beast, Atalanta was awarded its head, much to the chagrin of her male colleagues. Here Atalanta, wearing a maroon dress, holds court in the center of the painting as Meleager, in sky blue, points to the boar’s head held by a servant. The variety of colors and the rhetorical gestures of the figures, which lead the viewer’s eye across the canvas, are typical of the artist. Veronese (his nickname derived from his hometown of Verona) planned and executed small paintings like this with the same care and expensive materials he lavished on his largest works.","Until 1657, Giovanni Batta Raggi (b. 1613 - d. 1657), Genoa [see note 1], 1658, by inheritance to his brother, Cardinal Lorenzo Raggi (b. 1615 - d. 1687), Rome [see note 2], until at least 1780, probably by descent within the family, to Giulio Raggi, Genoa [see note 3], 1818, possibly still at the Raggi palace, Genoa [see note 4].

Caffieri stands beside a reduced version of his statue of the seventeenth-century dramatist Pierre Corneille, one from a series of the ""Great Men of France.""

The well-equipped kitchen-with its cauldron, roasting oven, mortar and pestle, reed chair, and cheeses on shelves-features a recessed sink with two pumps for water from the well and the cistern. The human element is typically rather insignificant in De Witte's work, here, a maidservant stands at the far end of the room with her back to the viewer, accompanied by only the family dog. A ghostly outline visible through thinning paint reveals that the artist originally placed the maid in front of the fire. The proportions and plan of the carefully articulated space, enlivened by sharp contrasts of light and dark, do not correspond to those of actual seventeenth-century Amsterdam kitchens, an element of fantasy marks De Witte's architectural views as well.

He sold much of his art collection in two sales in Berlin in May, 1933. He and his wife left Germany that summer, living for several years in Switzerland before immigrating to New York in 1941. Curt Glaser died in 1943 in Lake Placid, New York.;The heirs of Curt Glaser have sought restitution of the works of art auctioned in May, 1933, alleging that the sales were due to Nazi persecution and therefore forced. In 2009, the United Kingdom's Spoliation Advisory Panel issued a report regarding eight drawings that were auctioned in May, 1933. The Advisory Panel found that Glaser's decision to sell the bulk of his collection was due to a number of factors and that the prices attained at auction were fair. The panel concluded that the claim was not sufficiently strong to recommend restitution of the drawings.
